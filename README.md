## OpenGL-Renderer

A simple renderer made with OpenGL and C++. Using this repository as a starting point in the long journey that will be learning about Computer Graphics. This renderer will include all the basic rendering data types and primitives as learning experience. I hope to be able to use this knowledge to create a Voxel game using OpenGL in the future and even make a basic game engine.

## Tech/framework used

- GLFW (window management and mouse and keyboard IO)
- GLEW (modern OpenGL extensions)
- stb_image (used to load textures)
- glm (math library for matrix and vector logic)

## Features

- Scene & Model Classes
- Textures
- Logger
- Shader Parsing and Compilation
- Vertex Array Abstraction
- Vertex Attribute Pointer Abstraction
- Vertex Buffer Abstraction
- Index Buffer Abstraction

Thanks to The Cherno and learnopengl.com. The two main sources which have helped me learn what is in this repository. :D
